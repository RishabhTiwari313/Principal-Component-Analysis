PCA is a Unsupervised Machine Learning technique where there is only X variables ( independent variable) and no Y variable ( dependent variable).
It is a dimensionality reduction technique that allows you to select minimum number of features that carry maximum number of information.
It finds co-variance of every variable on the basis of that eigen vector is generated.
( Eigen vector indicates how much variance does each X variable contribute to in the data.)
PCA is sensitive to Outliers and the pre-requisite of using PCA is the data should be standardized.
